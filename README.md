# Create_MasterOrder
As a BI Analyst, I have created a new table named "mastertable" in MySQL, which consolidates data from four existing tables: customers, orders, product category, and products.The "mastertable" contains the following information:

CustomerEmail (cust_email)
CustomerCity (cust_city)
OrderDate (order_date)
OrderQty (order_qty)
ProductName (product_name)
ProductPrice (product_price)
ProductCategoryName (category_name)
TotalSales (total_sales)

This consolidated table provides a comprehensive view of customer-related information, including their email addresses, city of residence, and details of orders placed, such as order date, quantity, product name, price, product category, and total sales. It serves as a valuable resource for conducting business intelligence analysis and generating insights into customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends.
